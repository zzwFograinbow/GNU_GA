# GNU_GA


This project is primarily based on the web application framework built after studying the go-gin-example repository. It is a great resource for learning the Gin web framework.

After modifications, the main purpose of this project is to build a web application framework that facilitates the distribution of strategies from a central server to algorithm servers. This functionality will be implemented in version v0.1.0.

The project primarily utilizes the following open-source frameworks:

Gin: https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin


Gorm: https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm
